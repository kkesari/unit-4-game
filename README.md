The player will have to guess the answer, just like in Word Guess. The player will guess with numbers instead of letters. 
Here's how the app works:
<br>
<br>
<br>


There are four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.
<br>
The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.
<br>
<br>

When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 
<br>
<br>
<br>


Game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
<br>
When they do click one, the player's score counter will be updated, adding the number to the total score.
<br>
<br>


The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.
<br>
The player loses if their score goes above the random number.
<br>
<br>
The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.
<br>
<br>


When the game begins again, the player will see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.
<br>
<br>
<br>

The app will show the number of games the player wins and loses. Users do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game
